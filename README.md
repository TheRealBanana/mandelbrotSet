# mandelbrotSet

More boredom means more coding. Decided to do what everyone and their grandma's has already done: Visualize the Mandelbrot Set. 

This code is super ugly because I wanted to make it without looking at any other code, just me and the maths. 
In paricular I'm not quite sure how best to color based on escape velocities (or even how to calculate the escape velocity in a sane way)

At least it prints something though so I'm happy. Multithreading will also need to come since this is super slow.
